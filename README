The file "constants.rb" is used to establish certain paramaters in an easy-going way.

For the well functioning of the project it is needed two files in the directory ./examples/data. Those files must be in a CSV format. One must contain the instances itself and the other one must contain some information of the instances.
Examples in "Instances.csv"

Att1;Att2;Att3;AttN;Class X1;X2;X3;XN;XC Y1;Y2;Y3;YN;YC ... Z1;Z2;Z3;ZN;ZC
Examples in "Attributes.csv"
